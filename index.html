              before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and
              have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
              the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
              thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers,
              working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>
